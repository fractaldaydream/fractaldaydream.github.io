<p>Today started out like any other day – reluctantly getting up and going to school, sitting through boring lessons, highschool drama and teenage angst. My teacher, Mr Stephenson, was currently teaching History in his somewhat unorthodox manner. He knew most people hated the subject, so rather than trying to control the class through strictness or ‘fun’ activities, he just ignored anyone not wanting to learn and had group discussions with those who did. As he put it, “I don’t give a crap whether you pass or not. I already did.” Thanks to this attitude, he actually had some respect among the more disruptive students – they’d just go on their phones or talk on the other side of the classroom.</p>
<p>“So guys, do you think he was right? Are those who don’t learn from history doomed to repeat it?” asked Mr Stephenson.</p>
<p>I raised my hand to give my opinion – and then I noticed it wasn’t there. My wrist just cut off below the hand, leaving a shimmering, indistinct blur where it should have been. I quickly put my hand – stump? – down and hid it under the desk. By some miracle nobody had noticed. Except Mr Stephenson.</p>
<p>“Dawn, don’t change your mind. What were you going to say?” said Mr Stephenson, looking at me interestedly.</p>
<p>“Uhhh… Well in a purely literal sense, it doesn’t seem correct, at least not intuitively. The odds of similar events repeating throughout history goes against our gut feelings about probability. But when you look at the evidence, he’s right. We still have wars, for example. Not on the scale of World War Two, but we make a point of remembering it so as not to repeat it. Of course, the quote is actually a metaphor about learning from your mistakes,” I said hurriedly.</p>
<p>“Some excellent points. Anyone else?” He looked around the room.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if Mr Stephenson had seen anything unusual, my ad-lib answer had sent him off on a tangent. I looked under the desk at my arm. My hand was still missing. I tentatively reached for the area where it should have been – and touched flesh. A quick exploration by touch revealed that the hand was still there – I just couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>So, my hand was still there, but why couldn’t I see it? This must be some sort of trick my mind was playing on me. It could have been lack of sleep or drugs, but I knew better. I had a good sleep the night before, but school I attended was in a rough part of town. It could be that someone slipped something into my food or drink when I wasn’t looking, as a joke. Ha ha, not very funny. I looked around to see if anything else was off, but no, it all looked normal. What kind of hallucinogenic would affect just the way I see my right hand, and nothing else?</p>

</code></pre><p>It could have been invisibility but that couldn’t be right, as I could still see a slight shimmer in the air where the hand should have been. It was almost as if my hand had tried to vanish, but didn’t have enough power to do it completely... Power. Could it be? I shook my head slightly. Superpowers don’t exist. I raised my left hand, the one that was still visible, and told Mr Stephenson that I had an appointment to go to. It was a lie, but I had to get out of there, fast. I wasn’t sure if he would believe me, but as he trusts me and knowing that I actually do the work set, unlike the rest of the class, he nodded and gestured for me to go while he found his train of thought again. I put my invisible hand in my pocket and grabbed my things with the other. I put them in my bag, stood up and made my way to the door.</p>
<p>I made my way out of the hall and into reception. I didn’t say anything to them and they didn’t seem to notice me, which was odd. I went through the door, which was left open, and out into the winter afternoon. The air was cold and the wind was biting. I shivered a little and left the school campus. No one who I passed down the street paid any attention to me, which I was highly grateful for. I didn’t need some busybody calling the school, or worse; police, because they saw someone my age out of lessons during school hours.</p>
<p>I walked down the road, deep in thought about this strange new ability I seem to have acquired. I knew that I could turn my hand semi-invisible, although there was a slight shimmer to it. I decided to go home and try to figure out what was going on. Could I make the rest of my arm go invisible? Could I turn my whole body invisible? Was anything else going to change? The possibility that I could permanently disappear made my heart beat a little faster.</p>
<p>I was so lost in my train of thought that I didn’t notice the car pull out in front of me until it was nearly too late. I tried to move backwards, but the car was almost upon me by then. It clipped my leg and I cried out in surprise as pain shot through it. The driver slowed to a stop, pulled over and got out of the car. The petite lady, who looked to be about forty years old, looked around with a shocked look on her face, probably wondering where the noise was coming from and what hit her car. She looked right through me, almost as if I were a ghost. Then it hit me - nobody could see me! It would explain a lot, such as why the receptionists and passers by took no notice of me. I looked down at myself only to see a faint shimmering, like the way air distorts above a fire. It struck me as odd that no one seemed to have noticed it, but I figured that they weren’t looking too hard. I limped away from the dumbfounded woman and down my street. I paid close attention to where I was going; I didn’t want to get hit by any more cars.</p>
<p>I reached my house within the next 5 minutes, hugging close to the wall to stay away from any traffic or people that could bump into me. I unlocked the door and stepped inside.</p>
<p>Luckily, both my parents were out so I had the place to myself, for the next few hours at least. I locked the front door behind me, then ran upstairs to my room. I also locked my bedroom door behind me too, just to be on the safe side, and crossed the room to look in my mirror.</p>
<p>It was like looking through a window. I couldn’t see myself at all, not even the shimmering that I’d seen earlier. I looked down at myself and could still see it. I held my hand out in front of me, palm up, and sure enough I could see the outline of my hand where everything behind it blurred and rippled. I looked back up at the mirror, but I couldn’t see anything - apart from a distinct lack of myself.</p>
<p>On a hunch, I got my phone out, which was visible wherever my hand wasn’t covering it, and opened the camera app. I switched to the front camera and pointed it myself. Still nothing, even when I zoomed in. If I put my finger over the lens, the picture remained unobscured.</p>
<p>I stood still for a moment, gathering my thoughts. Even if I accepted the fact I was invisible, it still didn’t make any sense that my clothes were also invisible, but objects I held weren’t. On top of that, I could see myself, but mirrors and phone cameras couldn’t.</p>
<p>I was by no means an expert in physics, but I was fairly certain that several of its laws were being broken right now.</p>
<p>I shook my head and took a deep breath. Clearly, I wasn’t going to be able to understand this just yet. It would probably be more constructive to try and control it.</p>
<p>I looked in the mirror again and thought back to what I had been doing just before my hand turned invisible, back in Mr Stephenson's History lesson. I had just been listening to him ramble on about philosophy (another subject he taught), mildly interested, but also slightly distracted. When he had asked his question, I had raised my hand - nothing had happened before then to alert me to what had happened.</p>
<p>Which reminded me of something else - I didn’t feel any different. I wasn’t tingling, or buzzing with energy. My leg hurt, but there was a rational, logical explanation for that.</p>
<p>I stared into the mirror and willed myself to become visible again. Very slowly, I started to be able to see myself in the mirror. It started as the same distorted blurriness I saw when I looked down at myself, and gradually coalesced into a figure with blonde wavy hair and brown eyes that I knew well. It wasn’t a smooth, linear process - depending on how I thought about it and how much I willed it, the speed varied, with no clear correlation between effort and the rate at which I reappeared.</p>
<p>Once I could see myself fully again, I checked with the mirror and phone camera that I was back and I was entirely visible.</p>
<p>Satisfied I hadn’t missed a spot, I began experimenting, very slowly fading in and out of sight over the course of a few minutes. Over the next half hour, I found the mental ‘switch’ that made me vanish, and soon I could turn invisible and then materialize in less than a minute.</p>
<p>I grinned. Despite the crazy, impossible scenario I was in, this ability was very cool. My mind turned to potential uses for it. Getting around unnoticed could be very helpful - I could go almost anywhere, leave school early, eavesdrop. The possibilities were endless.</p>
<p>I walked across the room and sat down in my chair</p>
<p>I’m not a huge fan of the superhero genre, but I had read some comics and seen a handful of superhero movies, so naturally the thought of being a hero crossed my mind - I wouldn’t even need a costume! However, I put the notion aside for the time being. For one, I hadn’t ruled out the possibility that I was hallucinating. Also, even if I could turn invisible, I was still a 5’6” skinny girl who would become very dead if someone shot blindly at me.</p>
<p>Another avalanche of thoughts and ideas opened up - should I tell anybody about this? My parents, Friends? I was fairly sure they would freak out.  Wondered if they would go to the police or media The media seemed more likely, and then it was entirely possible that government could lock me up to experiment on.</p>
<p>The combination of the excitement of having this new power and the steadily increasing worry it brought made me more impulsive than normal. I abruptly stood and went back to my door, unlocked it and rushed down the stairs.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-ii">Chapter II</h3>
<p>Once at the front door, I turned invisible again, using the hallway mirror to check I couldn’t be seen, and then carefully went outside, looking around to make sure that nobody would see the door open and close itself.</p>
<p>Walking down the street, I tried to keep to the shadows and make myself as small as possible. I didn’t know how reliable this power was. For all I knew, I would reappear in the middle of a crowded street. With all eyes on me, I knew that it would be difficult to explain. I saw a bus approaching a bus stop nearby. The station was packed with people. I tried to stay at the back of the crowd. I was acutely aware that I could still interact with people, meaning that they could still feel me even if they couldn’t see me. I was the last on the bus and was about to scan my card when I realised that it wouldn’t matter, the driver couldn’t see me anyway. I walked up the stairs and sat at the back of the bus, as far away from prying eyes to keep the damage to a minimal if I became visible again.</p>
<p>As I took the trip into town, I thought about my powers. I wondered if I could stop people perceiving my touch, to make myself totally imperceivable. I also wondered about whether my invisibility extended to all regions of the colour spectrum. I knew about visible light, which is the light wavelength that humans see things on. There are also other wavelengths, such as infrared and ultraviolet. These are wavelengths of light that the human eye cannot see. Does my invisibility extend that far, or would I trip infrared sensors and become visible if I was doused with ultraviolet paint? I didn’t know, but I made a mental note to try to find out.</p>
<p>As the bus drew closer, I made the decision to try to steal something. (is this a good idea, possible more thought into the matter required) After all, I was a good person all the time. I’d seen others in my class get rich from crime, and it wasn’t fair that my family was relatively poor. In fact, so many rich businessmen get more profits with morally questionable and even illegal methods</p>
